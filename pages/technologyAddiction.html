            <p class="title">Tech Takeover</p>
            <p class="hi">Technology has taken over the world and the new generation. It has become more and more popular in
                today's day of age. With the rise of technology people have grown a severe addiction to it. Using
                technology and social media sites has become the new normal. used to communicate to friends and family,
                used in healthcare, transportation, education etc.. Technology has impacted everybody's lives in
                different ways.</p>
            <p class="title">Tech Obession</p>
            <p class="hi">Technology addiction is very real. The meaning behind technology addiction is “when an obsessive and
                impulsive use of technology causes negative consequences to the user.” (“Technology Addiction Treatment
                in Austin TX.”) Technology addiction is not so common in older people but definitely common with the new
                generation. Many mental health experts have noticed that the percentage of technology users use
                technology in a “compulsive and out-of-control manner.” (“What You Need to Know About Internet
                Addiction.”</p>

            <div>
                <p class="d-flex justify-content-end title">Addiction & Gambling</p>
                <p class="d-flex justify-content-end paragraph hi">Being addicted to technology and social media sites is
                    like being addicted to gambling. Social media sites and gambling use the same reward schedule. This
                    reward schedule that is being use in gambling and on social media sites was created by B.F Skinner
                    and Charles Fester (Miller). B.F Skinner was a psychologist known for his “impact on
                    behaviorism”(Cherry). The reason why gambling is so addicting is because of this certain reward
                    schedule. Gambling triggers the reward system in the part of the brains which is why people cannot
                    pull away from the slot, which is similar to social media sites and technology. Instead of not
                    pulling away from the slot is the same way how people are with technology. People see something that
                    catches their attention on their feed and keep scrolling and scrolling and end up in a rabbit hole.
