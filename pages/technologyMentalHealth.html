            <p class="para hi">People's mental health and how much they are on the internet are connected. Being addicted
                to technology is
                not healthy for people's brains or bodies at all. Being addicted could negatively affect mental health
                and
                could possibly harm their emotional state. Technology addiction can cause people severe mood swings,
                anxiety
                and even possibly develop sleep disorders. Teenagers are constantly on their phones day and night. Those
                that are addicted to technology tend to develop sleeping disorders because they are up all night using
                technology.</p>

                There are studies that have shown the brain scans of teens and young adults that suffer from internet
                addiction are similar to those who suffer from substance addiction (Hazelden.) “Damage to brain systems
                connecting emotional processing, attention, and decision-making are affected in both substance addicts
                and technology addicts. This discovery shows that being hooked on a tech behavior can, in some ways, be
                as physically damaging as an addiction to alcohol and other drug use” (Hazelden).

            <p class="para hi">Nowadays whoever is suffering from hard times they often use technology as an escape from
                reality. Our new
                generation often use technology as a distraction to make themselves feel better or as an escape from
                whatever they are going through. There was a survey taken in 2019 that showed 40% of technology users in
                the
                U.S population are addicted to social media. (Zuckerman.)</p>
